# Trading Arena - Strategic Stock Battle

**Trading Arena** is a two-player strategy card game where players manage stock portfolios and deploy derivatives (Puts, Calls) to attack opponents and defend their Net Worth. It uses **real historical stock data** (10 years via Yahoo Finance), **Black-Scholes option pricing**, and a **C++ AI engine** - turning financial market analysis into a competitive, strategic experience.

## Overview

Players start with **£1,000** and compete over **5 rounds**, each representing a **3-month market quarter**. Every round has three phases:

1. **Buy Phase** - Purchase stock cards from a randomly generated market.
2. **Action Phase** - Assign derivative actions (Place, Call, Defense Put, Attack Put) to your holdings and target opponent assets.
3. **Battle Phase** - Time jumps 3 months forward, stock prices reveal, combat resolves, and Net Worth updates.

The player with the highest Net Worth at the end wins - or knock your opponent to £0 for an early KO.

### Game Modes

| Mode | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Play vs AI** | Offline single-player against a C++ heuristic bot |
| **Multiplayer** | Real-time two-player via Socket.IO |

## How It Works

### The Game Board

| Zone | Purpose |
|------|---------|
| **The Market (Shop)** | 5 randomly generated stock cards available for purchase each round |
| **Holdings (Bench)** | Stocks the player owns - passively grow/shrink via market movement ($\omega$) |
| **The Portfolio (Arena)** | Where players assign actions to attack opponents or defend their Net Worth |
| **Net Worth Tracker** | The player's "health bar" - hits zero and you lose |

### Combat Math

| Action | Formula | Effect |
|--------|---------|--------|
| **Bench (Passive)** | $\omega = S_1 - S_0$ | Added to owner's NW automatically |
| **Place / Call** | $\Delta = \max(0, S_1 - S_0)$ | Subtracted from opponent's NW |
| **Attack Put** | $\Delta = \max(0, S_0 - S_1)$ | Subtracted from opponent's NW |
| **Defense Put** | $\Delta = \max(0, S_0 - S_1)$ | Added to owner's NW (offsets bench losses) |

Options (Call, Put) charge a **Black-Scholes premium** upfront, deducted from your NW.

### End-of-Game Analytics

The game renders a full analytics dashboard:
- **Total Profit** - net gain/loss from starting £1,000
- **Options Win Rate** - percentage of derivatives that produced positive value
- **Max Drawdown** - peak-to-trough drop in NW
- **NW Over Time Chart** - line chart tracking portfolio value per round
- **AI Strategy Advisor** - LLM-powered post-game analysis (Groq or OpenAI)

## Installation & Setup

### Prerequisites

- **Python 3.10+**
- **g++ (64-bit)** - only needed for the offline AI bot & backtester

### 1. Clone & install dependencies

```bash
git clone <repo-url>
cd FintechHack26
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

### 2. Compile the C++ engine (optional - enables smart AI)

The offline bot uses a compiled C++ heuristic engine. Without it, the bot falls back to random moves.

**Windows (MinGW-w64):**

```powershell
# Install a 64-bit compiler if needed:
winget install BrechtSanders.WinLibs.POSIX.UCRT

# Compile (must match Python architecture - typically 64-bit):
cd backtester
x86_64-w64-mingw32-g++ -shared -O2 -o engine.dll engine.cpp
```

**Linux / macOS:**

```bash
cd backtester
g++ -shared -fPIC -O2 -o engine.so engine.cpp
```

### 3. Set up LLM insights (optional)

For AI-powered post-game strategy analysis, set one of these environment variables:

```bash
# Groq (free, recommended - uses llama-3.1-8b-instant)
export GROQ_API_KEY=your_key_here

# OR OpenAI (uses gpt-4o-mini)
export OPENAI_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

## Running the Game

### Start the server

```bash
python app.py
```

Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000) in your browser.

### Play vs AI (offline)

1. Open [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
2. Click **"Play vs AI"**
3. You are Player 1; the C++ bot plays as Player 2 automatically

### Play Multiplayer (two players)

Multiplayer uses Socket.IO - both players connect to the **same server**.

#### Same machine (local)

1. Start the server: `python app.py`
2. Open **two browser tabs** to [http://localhost:5000](http://localhost:5000)
3. In **both tabs**, click **"Multiplayer"**
4. The first tab becomes Player 1, the second becomes Player 2
5. The game starts once both players are connected

#### Same network (LAN)

1. Find the host machine's local IP:
   ```powershell
   # Windows
   ipconfig     # look for IPv4 Address (e.g. 192.168.1.42)
   ```
   ```bash
   # Linux / macOS
   hostname -I
   ```
2. Start the server on the host: `python app.py`
3. On the **second device**, open `http://<host-ip>:5000` (e.g. `http://192.168.1.42:5000`)
4. Both players click **"Multiplayer"**
5. Game starts when both are connected

> **Note:** Both devices must be on the same Wi-Fi / network. The server binds to `0.0.0.0:5000`, so it accepts connections from any device on the LAN.

#### Over the internet

To play with someone on a different network, expose port 5000 using one of these methods:

| Method | Command / Steps |
|--------|----------------|
| **ngrok** (recommended) | `ngrok http 5000` - gives a public URL like `https://abc123.ngrok.io` |
| **localtunnel** | `npx localtunnel --port 5000` |
| **Port forwarding** | Forward port 5000 on your router to your machine's local IP |

Share the public URL with the other player. Both click **"Multiplayer"** to start.

#### Multiplayer flow

```
Player 1 opens page → clicks "Multiplayer" → enters lobby (waiting...)
Player 2 opens page → clicks "Multiplayer" → joins lobby
                                             → game starts automatically
```

Both players go through Buy Phase and Action Phase simultaneously. Each phase advances when **both** players click their ready/confirm button. If one player disconnects, the other is notified via the trade log.

### Run the backtester (standalone)

```bash
cd backtester
python backtest.py
```

Runs **10,000 simulated games** (AI vs random) and reports win rate, average profit, and max drawdown.
